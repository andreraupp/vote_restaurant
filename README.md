# Where lunch?
App for vote in your restaurant prefered and decide together of coworkers where lunch. 

Implemented rules:
restaurants that are within a radius of up to 1.5km will be displayed;
the voting closes at 12:45 p.m., after which it will only be reopened the next day;
all users will receive a notification at 12: 45h, stating that we already have a winning restaurant.

Platform and language chosen:
Native Android, java.

What are the highlights of your logic/code writing style?
I tried to follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) standard and also recommendations of materials provided by Google itself.

What could have been done in a better way?
To be implemented logics in the backend (server) where it would facilitate the maintenance of the data and would diminish the processing in the mobile.

Any other notes you judge relevant for the evaluation of your project.
Some services of the Firebase platform were used as database and push service.
